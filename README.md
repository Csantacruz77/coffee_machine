# coffee_machine
Basic Coffee Machine Interface using OOP:\n
This code uses Object Oriented Programming to simulate a program for a coffee machine. It allows users to input what they would like to order
and once that has been completed it checks whether the resources are available to make that order. If the machine has the resources it then 
tells the user how much their order is and asks for payment. The program then calculates the payment, and if it is sufficient it gives back any change.
Finally once the order and payment process is complete it tells the machine to make the coffee and deducts the amount of used resources from the
total resource pool and readies itself for the next order.
